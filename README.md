# Travel Agency Website -- Bhromaon

A responsive travel agency website built as part of my frontend development learning journey. This project helped me practice real-world layout techniques, SCSS organization, and interactive UI features.

## Project Overview

Bhromaon is a multi-section travel website where I focused on using SCSS (Sass) with a clean folder structure, consistent styling, and responsive design. I also added simple JavaScript interactions such as menu toggles and smooth scrolling.

This project represents my growing skills in structuring styles, improving design workflows, and building pages that work well across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Main Features

- Hero section with search area
- Bottom-positioned navigation inside hero
- Mobile hamburger menu with toggle animation
- "How It Works" process section
- Destination cards with content layout
- Testimonials section
- Smooth scrolling between sections

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- SCSS / Sass (using 7-1 architecture pattern)
- CSS3 -- Flexbox, Grid, transitions
- RemixIcon

## SCSS Structure (7-1 Architecture)

I used the 7-1 pattern to organize my styles into clear folders and partials:

```
scss/
├── abstract/
│   ├── _mixins.scss
│   └── _variables.scss
├── base/
│   ├── _base.scss
│   └── _topology.scss
├── components/
│   ├── _footer.scss
│   └── _header.scss
├── sections/
│   ├── _choose-us.scss
│   ├── _how-it-works.scss
│   ├── _location.scss
│   └── _testimonial.scss
└── main.scss
```

## Design Highlights

- Organized typography and spacing
- Simple but clean color palette
- Smooth hover and transition effects

## Responsive Design

- Desktop (primary focus)
- Tablet

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ernestdogosson/travel-agency-website--bharomaon.git
cd travel-agency-website
```

Compile SCSS:

```bash
sass scss/main.scss css/main.css --watch
```

Open `index.html` in your browser.

## What I Learned

- Structuring SCSS using 7-1 pattern
- Building responsive layouts
- Organizing files and components
- Handling basic DOM interaction
- Improving general UI/UX decisions
